CNN:
    Uses CTQ (48 bins, 12 per octave -C5 in 523 Hz-) + Mel (24 frecs, fmax 600). CQT are downsampled to 24 by mean averaging.
    Takes 32 timesteps of len 1024 (for Mel) with 128 hop.
    Squared filters 
    p             = [7, 5, 3, 3]   # Conv2D mask size
    d             = [5, 8, 12,16]   # Conv2D channels
    f             = [20]
    droprate      = 0.25
    Binary_Crossentropy loss
    Adam optimizer

RNN:
    Uses CTQ (48 bins, 12 per octave -C5 in 523 Hz-) + Mel (24 frecs, fmax 600)
    Takes 30 timesteps of len 1024 (for Mel) with 128 hop.
    40 hidden units per layer
    two LSTM in each layer
    dropout (0.25) after last layer
    Binary_Crossentropy loss
    RMSprop loss

MIDI:
    All low notes are included (Limit is G3- 196 Hz)
